Whoa there, you don't have the required modules to run this Makefile.PL!
This probably means you cloned the repository from github (if you
encounter this from a tarball uploaded to CPAN, it's a bug, so please
report it).

If you are running from a cloned git repository, install the following
modules first:
EOM
    foreach my $module (@missing) {
        $module =~ s/^inc:://;
        print STDERR "    * $module\n";
    }
    print STDERR <<EOM;
and try again.

While you're at it, install these modules as they are needed to run
the tests:

* Test::Fatal
* Test::Requires
* Test::TCP
* Devel::CheckLib

EOM
    exit 0;
}
Module::Install->import;
