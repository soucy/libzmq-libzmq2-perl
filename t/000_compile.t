*** WARNING ***

You're using libzmq '%s'!

It is known that when used with libzmq < 2.1, some calls to 
    \$socket->recv()
does not terminate even when a signal is sent (in such cases you
need to resort to using SIGKILL). 

You should really be thinking about upgrading your libzmq to 2.1 or
higher, and recompile ZMQ::LibZMQ2.pm against the new library.

    ($major + $minor / 10) < 2.1 ? $warning : ''
